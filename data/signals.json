      "reason": "RSI ~55 (neutral‑slightly bullish), MACD line above signal and rising, price above EMA9 and EMA9 above EMA21, Bollinger Bands expanding with price hugging the lower‑mid band suggesting room to move up, Stochastic around 70‑80 indicating momentum, recent candles show higher closes after a brief pullback and the overall trend on the 1‑min chart is upward. Combined with low volatility (0.24%) the setup favors a short‑term bullish move.",
