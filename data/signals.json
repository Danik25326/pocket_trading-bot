Price is near the lower Bollinger Band and a bearish engulfing pattern appeared at 00:16, indicating further downside. Stochastic is below 20 and falling, supporting oversold conditions.

      "duration": 3,
      "reason": "RSI≈50 (neutral), MACD≈0 (no momentum), price slipped below the 9‑EMA and is near the lower Bollinger Band, Stochastic around 45‑55 (no overbought), EMA9 below EMA21 indicating slight bearish bias, and the last three candles form a bearish engulfing pattern. Combined these suggest a short‑term down move with sufficient confidence.",
