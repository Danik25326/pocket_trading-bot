      "reason": "RSI appears low (near oversold) on limited data, MACD line is approaching zero from below, EMA9 is still below EMA21 indicating a longer‑term downtrend but recent three candles (02:22‑02:24) are bullish, price is near the lower Bollinger Band suggesting room to rise, and stochastic hints at upward momentum – together these give a short‑term upside bias.",
