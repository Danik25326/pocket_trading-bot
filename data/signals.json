      "reason": "Price showed a sharp dip from 20:52 to 20:53 followed by three consecutive bullish candles (20:54‑20:56). The recent close is moving back toward the upper side of the likely Bollinger range, and the price appears to have crossed above short‑term EMAs (9/21). Candlestick pattern suggests a reversal (bullish engulfing after a long bearish candle). RSI is presumed near neutral‑slightly bullish, MACD likely turning positive, and Stochastic exiting oversold, supporting an upward short‑term move.",
