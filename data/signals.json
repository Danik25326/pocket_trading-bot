      "reason": "EMA9 (≈149.64) is above EMA21 (≈149.60) indicating a short‑term uptrend, but RSI≈79 and Stochastic≈85 show overbought conditions. Recent candles (06:45‑06:47) turned bearish with a bearish engulfing pattern, and price is sliding back toward the middle of the Bollinger Bands. The convergence of overbought momentum and a bearish candlestick reversal suggests a likely pull‑back within the next 3 minutes.",
