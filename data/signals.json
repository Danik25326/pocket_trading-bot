      "reason": "RSI is below 50 and approaching oversold levels, Stochastic is under 20, MACD histogram is negative and narrowing, price is touching the lower Bollinger Band while EMA‑9 is slightly above EMA‑21 indicating a potential short‑term bounce. Recent candles show a bearish swing but the last 21:17 candle is a small bullish engulfing after a series of declines, suggesting a reversal. Combined signals give a >75% confidence for a short‑term upward move.",
