EMA 9 is below EMA 21, MACD histogram is negative and narrowing, RSI hovers around 48‑50 indicating no strong momentum, Bollinger Bands are contracting with price near the lower half of the band, and Stochastic is around 40‑45, suggesting bearish bias. Low volatility (0.08 %) supports a short‑term continuation of the down move.",
