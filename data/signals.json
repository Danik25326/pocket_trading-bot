      "reason": "Price shows a clear short‑term uptrend: last two 1‑min candles close higher (220.934→221.196→221.215). EMA‑9 is above EMA‑21, MACD histogram turned positive, RSI is around 62 (above 50 but below overbought), Bollinger Bands indicate price near the upper band but still within range, Stochastic is high (~78) suggesting momentum. No bearish reversal patterns observed; recent candles form a bullish continuation. Confidence meets the 75% threshold.",
