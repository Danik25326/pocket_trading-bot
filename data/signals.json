      "reason": "Recent 8‑minute candles show a clear upward bias: price moved from 208.746 to 209.338 (+0.28%). EMA9 is above EMA21, MACD histogram is positive and the MACD line sits above its signal. Stochastic is in the upper‑mid range (~78) indicating momentum, while RSI is near 70, suggesting strength but not yet extreme overbought. Bollinger Bands show price hugging the upper band, confirming bullish pressure. A bullish engulfing pattern at 17:44‑17:45 supports a short‑term continuation. All indicators align, giving a high‑confidence BUY signal.",
